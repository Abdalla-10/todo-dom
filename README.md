## Todo list using DOM💪🏾

Your task is to create a todo list using DOM.

##### Your Task 😃:

1. Using your DOM knowledge when user enters a task in the textbox and click the button
   - You need to create a new div element with the task user entered as the text
   - Give the new div element you created the class name of `task`
   - Append the new div element with the new task to the div with the class name of `tasks`

Good Luck 😀
